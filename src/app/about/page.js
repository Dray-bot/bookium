          We believe books are more than just pages theyâ€™re passports. To other worlds, new perspectives, 
          and better versions of ourselves. Bookium exists to keep that magic alive. With a clean, 
          focused interface and a curated library built for readers in Nigeria, this isnâ€™t about having 
          everything itâ€™s about having the right things.
